# Northwind SQL Analytics

This repository contains my SQL scripts and analysis to extract insights from the Northwind Traders sample database. Throughot this project, I aim to practice and demonstrate my proficiency with techniques including window functions, common table expressions, and various analytical functions to complete tasks based on business needs.


## Database Information
I'm working with a PostgreSQL version of the classic Northwind database, which can be found on [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/pthom/northwind_psql/tree/master). This sample database contains realistic business data including:
- Customers and their orders
- Products and categories
- Employees and their territories
- Suppliers and shipping information
